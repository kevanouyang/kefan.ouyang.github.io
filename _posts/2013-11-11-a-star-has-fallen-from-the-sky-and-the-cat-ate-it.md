Dicranopteris pedata is a medicinal herb widely distributed in south China,but not widely utilized. The crude flavonoids were extracted using ultrasonic-assisted extraction,separated and purified by polyamide resin column chromatography with gradient elution.After the main components were identified by HPLC,in vitro antioxidant activity was investigated.The results showed that the yield of flavonoids from Dicranopteris pedata was 13.42%,and the total flavonoids content of the purified 50%ethanol gradient elution was the highest, reaching 76.25%,mainly containing afzelin(2.155%)and luteolin-5-O-glucoside(1.462%),isoquercitrin (0.856%).The scavenging values IC_(50)of the flavonoids from Dicranopteris pedata on hydroxyl(·OH),DPPH, ABTS+free radicals were 1 079.01,248.74and 50.14mug/mL respectively.Dicranopteris pedata had a high content of flavonoids and excellent antioxidant activity,which is of great development value.
