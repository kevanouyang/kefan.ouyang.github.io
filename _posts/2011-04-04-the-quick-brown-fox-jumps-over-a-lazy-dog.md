title: Enhancing rice protein using natural deep eutectic solvents
subtitle: Enhancing the solubility and emulsion properties of rice protein by deamidation of citric acid-based natural deep eutectic solvents.
description: The characteristics of rice protein deamidated (DRP) by choline chloride-citric acid and glucose-citric acid natural deep eutectic solvents (G-C NADES, C-C NADES) at different dilutions were investigated. Compared with the effect of citric acid deamidation on the structural and functional properties of the protein, the DRP from the NADESs led to remarkable differences in the degree of hydrolysis (DH), SDS-PAGE, morphology, surface hydrophobicity, average particle size, intrinsic fluorescence, amino acid compositions, and emulsion activity. The results of SDS-PAGE, DH, and SEM showed the NADESs reduced the occurrence of uncontrolled hydrolysis of protein during acid deamidation. DRP from C-C and G-C NADESs was found to significantly improve solubility. DRP prepared by C-C NADES showed a more than 40% solubility over a wide pH range associated with its higher emulsifying activity (37.62–44.19 m2/g) and emulsifying stability (73.76–86.9 min), as well as a better deamidation effect while lower DH. Thus, these findings showed that acid-based NADESs had great potential as a modified RP product to expand its application.
