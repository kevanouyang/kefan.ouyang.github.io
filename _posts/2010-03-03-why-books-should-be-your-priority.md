Yeast protein concentrate, a by-product of the fermentation industry waste, is a potential alternative protein source with high nutritional quality, environmental sustainability, and functional properties. However, its digestibility and digestion behavior are poorly understood. In this study, we compared the in vitro digestion behavior of yeast protein concentrate and whey protein concentrate using simulated gastrointestinal conditions. We found that yeast protein concentrate had lower digestibility than whey protein concentrate (31.25% vs. 86.23% at 120 min of pepsin digestion and 75.12% vs. 95.2% at 120 min of pancreatin digestion). Yeast protein concentrate differed from whey protein concentrate in microstructure, secondary structure, and amino acid composition, which may affect its digestion behavior. Compared to whey protein concentrate, a higher level of Î²-sheets and a lower zeta potential explain the slow-digesting property of yeast protein concentrate. Yeast protein concentrate also underwent depolymerization and Plastein reaction during digestion. These results provided valuable information for developing and applying yeast protein concentrate as an alternative to conventional animal protein.
